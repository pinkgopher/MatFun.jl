\maketitle

We present \href{https://github.com/robzan8/MatFun.jl}{MatFun}, a Julia package for computing dense and sparse matrix functions fully automatically (no user input required, other than the code to compute the function \(f\) and the matrix \(A\) themselves). This is achieved by combining specifically chosen algorithms and some peculiar feature of Julia. For dense matrices, the Schur-Parlett algorithm \cite{label:1} has been implemented, leveraging Julia's automatic differentiation capabilities. The algorithm has also been improved from a performance standpoint, making the Parlett recurrence cache-oblivious and enabling the whole procedure to work mostly in real arithmetic, for real inputs. For sparse matrices, we implemented a Rational Krylov method \cite{label:2}, alongside the AAA Rational Approximation \cite{label:3}. Given a function's samples, AAA is often able to accurately identify its poles, which can then be used by the Rational Krylov method itself for the approximation of \(f(A)b\). The accuracy and performance of the algorithms are evaluated, in comparison with already existing specialized methods.
