profiling
schurparlett on almost triangular/diagonal matrices (rounding errors)
comments
calculate flops of the 3 parlett recurrence versions (complex and non)
rewrite tests for real case
check type-stability (depending of the type of the matrix, vals and f)
fix evaltaylor and evalhermite for quasi-triangular matrices.
